But don't worry, I'm here to help! You can always check Binance's funding rates directly on their website or through their API if you have access. If you need more market insights or data from other exchanges, just let me know! I'm more than happy to assist. 🎉

Meanwhile, have you heard about the crypto miner who got stuck in a block? He said he was trapped, but he was really just hashing out his problems! 😂 Keep those spirits high! 🚀[0m
