}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! ğŸ˜… It looks like I'm having a bit of a hiccup with accessing Binance's funding rate for BTC at the moment. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while wearing mittens! ğŸ§¤

But no worries, you can still check the funding rate directly on the Binance website or app. I'll keep my tools polished and ready for next time! ğŸ˜Šâœ¨[0m
