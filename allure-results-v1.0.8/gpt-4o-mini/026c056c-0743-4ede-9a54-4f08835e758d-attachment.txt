}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It looks like we're running into a bit of a "funding" hiccup with Binance! ğŸ˜… The funding rate information for BTC is currently unavailable due to location restrictions. It seems Binance is playing hard to get!

But don't worry; the crypto world is vast, and there are plenty of other exchanges out there! If there's another exchange or a different token you're interested in, just let me know! I'm here to help you navigate these market waters! ğŸš€ğŸ’°[0m
