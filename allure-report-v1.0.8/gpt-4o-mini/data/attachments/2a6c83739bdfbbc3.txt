But don't worry, we can still make sense of the market! The funding rate can fluctuate based on market dynamics, so it might be worth checking directly on Binance’s website or app if you’re looking for the most up-to-date info. 

If you have any other questions or need insights into another token, just let me know! 🎉[0m
