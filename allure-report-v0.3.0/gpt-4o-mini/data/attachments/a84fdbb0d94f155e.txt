}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It looks like we hit a little snag trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance! ğŸš§ It seems that the service is restricted from certain locations. Talk about being in a "funding" predicament! ğŸ˜…

But don't worry, I'm here to help! You can check the funding rate directly on the Binance platform or I can help you with other information or exchanges if you're interested. Just let me know what you're looking for! ğŸš€ğŸ’°[0m
