}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like I'm getting a bit of a "funding" restriction from Binance! 😅 But don’t worry, let’s not "BTC" sad about it. 

While I can't pull the funding rate from Binance directly, I can help explain what a funding rate is or how it affects trading strategies if you're interested! Or I can look up some general market trends or other tokens for you. Just let me know what tickles your fancy! 🎉💰[0m
