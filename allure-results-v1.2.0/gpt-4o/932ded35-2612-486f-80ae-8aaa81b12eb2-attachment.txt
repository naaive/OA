}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It seems like I'm having a little hiccup trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance. It's as if my GPS is off, and I'm lost in the internet's restricted zone! 🗺️🚧

Not to worry, you can check directly on Binance's platform until I find my way back. If there's anything else you'd like to know, just give me a shout! 📢💡[0m
