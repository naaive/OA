}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! ğŸ˜… It seems like I'm facing a little roadblock trying to fetch the funding rate from Binance due to some location restrictions. Binance must have put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign! ğŸš«

However, if you're looking for funding rates for BTC, you could check directly on the Binance platform or let me know if you want to explore any other exchanges. I'm here to help, no ifs, ands, or "bots" about it! ğŸ˜‚[0m
