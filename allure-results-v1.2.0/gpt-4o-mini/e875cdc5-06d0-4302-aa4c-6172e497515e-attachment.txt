}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like the Binance service is playing hard to get and isn't available from your location right now. ğŸ˜© But fret not! That doesn't mean we can't have a good time discussing funding rates!

The funding rate is like a little fee that traders pay to each other depending on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Think of it like a friendship tax for holding onto your tokens! ğŸ’¸

If you have access to another exchange or need help understanding how funding rates work, just let me know! I'm here to keep the crypto vibes flowing! ğŸš€âœ¨[0m
