}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like I hit a little snag trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance! ğŸ˜… The service is unavailable from my current location. I guess Binance is playing hard to get! 

But donâ€™t worry, we can still find a way to get that information! You might want to check the Binance website directly, or perhaps use a VPN to access it. 

If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, just let me know! I'm here to help you ride the crypto waves! ğŸŒŠğŸš€[0m
