}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like I'm facing a bit of a hiccup trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance. 😅 It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is in a restricted location! 

But don't worry, I'm still here to help! You might want to check directly on Binance or use another exchange. If you have another token or a different exchange in mind, let me know, and we'll keep this crypto party going! 🎉🚀[0m
