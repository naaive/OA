}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It looks like I'm having a little hiccup trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance. 🎢 It seems the service is unavailable from our current location. Maybe Binance's servers are playing hide and seek with me! 😅

But hey, don't let that stop you from enjoying the crypto ride! 🚀 If you have any other questions or if there's something else you'd like to explore, just let me know! 🌟[0m
