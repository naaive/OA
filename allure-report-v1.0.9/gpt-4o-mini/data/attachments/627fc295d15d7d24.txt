}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh snap! It looks like I'm having a bit of a "funding" dilemma here with Binance! 🚫🌐 Unfortunately, I can't access the funding rate for BTC on Binance right now due to some location restrictions. 

But hey, don't let that get you down! There are plenty of other exchanges out there, or you could check Binance's website directly. If you need help with anything else, just let me know! I'm here to help you avoid any "funding" confusion! 😄💰[0m
