The funding rate can fluctuate based on market conditions, so it’s always a good idea to check directly on the Binance platform if you want the most up-to-date info. It's like checking the weather before a picnic—nobody wants to be caught in the rain! ☔️

If you have any other questions or need information on a different exchange, feel free to ask! Let's keep this crypto party going! 🎉🚀[0m
