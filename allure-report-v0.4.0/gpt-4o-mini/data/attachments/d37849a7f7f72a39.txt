}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like I'm having a bit of a "funding" issue with Binance. 😅 Their service is unavailable from my location, which means I can't fetch the current funding rate for BTC directly.

But don't worry; I'm here to keep your spirits up! 🎉 You can easily check the funding rate on Binance by logging into your account and navigating to the futures section. It's like finding a pot of gold at the end of a crypto rainbow! 🌈

If you have any other questions or need information about different tokens, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you ride the crypto waves! 🌊✨[0m
