}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like Binance is playing a little hard to get right now, and it's saying "service unavailable" 😅. It could be due to some regional restrictions, which can be a real bummer when you're trying to get those funding rates!

But don't worry! You might want to check Binance's official website or app for the most accurate and up-to-date funding rates. They usually have all the juicy details! 🍉

If you have any other questions or need information on a different exchange or token, just let me know! I'm here to help! 🎉[0m
