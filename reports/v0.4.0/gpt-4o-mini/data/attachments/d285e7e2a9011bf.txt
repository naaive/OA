}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh snap! It seems I've hit a bit of a snag while trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance! 😱 It's like trying to enter a club but forgetting your ID—no entry allowed!

But fear not, my crypto comrade! 🕵️‍♂️ You could check Binance’s website directly, or you might want to look for some other exchanges. If you have another exchange in mind, just let me know, and we can give it another shot! 🎉[0m
