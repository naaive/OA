}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It seems like we're having trouble getting the funding rate for BTC on Binance right now. It's like trying to find your keys when they're in your pocket all along! ğŸ˜…

But don't worry, you can always check directly on Binance's website, or if you want, I can try to find the funding rate from another exchange. Just let me know! ğŸš€[0m
