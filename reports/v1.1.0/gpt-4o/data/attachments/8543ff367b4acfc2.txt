}[0m[32;1m[1;3mLooks like I'm having a bit of a hiccup retrieving the funding rate for BTC/USDT on Binance. ğŸ˜… It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack's off-limits!

No worries, though! You could check directly on Binance's platform, or if there's another exchange you're interested in, just let me know! I'm here to help you stay on top of the crypto game! ğŸš€ğŸ“ˆ[0m
