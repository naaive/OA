}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It seems like the funding rate for BTC on Binance is playing a bit hard to get right now. 😅 Apparently, it's on vacation in a restricted location and not available to chat. 

But don't worry, just like a good joke, there are always other options! If you want, I can try to fetch the funding rate from another exchange. Just let me know which one tickles your fancy! 🎭📈[0m
