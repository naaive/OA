However, I can suggest some popular cryptocurrency and blockchain news channels on Telegram that you may want to check out for the latest updates:

1. @CoinDesk
2. @TheTIE
3. @CryptoSlate
4. @CoindeskCartoons
5. @BitcoinMagazine

These channels are known for providing accurate and up-to-date information on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.

If you'd like, I can try to fetch news from these channels for you instead. Just let me know![0m
