}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It looks like I can't access Binance's funding rate for BTC right now. It seems my virtual passport is restricted! 🛂 But don’t worry, I'm still here to help you navigate the crypto seas! 🌊

You might want to check directly on Binance's website or use a crypto data aggregator to find the funding rate. It's like fishing for the best catch of the day! 🎣

If you have any other questions or need information about a different token or anything else, just let me know! I'm all ears and ready to dive in! 🐠💰[0m
