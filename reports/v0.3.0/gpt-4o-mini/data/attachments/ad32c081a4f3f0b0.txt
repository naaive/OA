}[0m[32;1m[1;3mIt seems like I'm experiencing a bit of a "blockchain traffic jam" when trying to fetch the funding rate from Binance! ğŸš§ğŸ’¥ Unfortunately, their service is currently restricted from my location.

But don't worry, I can still help you understand what a funding rate is! The funding rate is a periodic payment made between traders who are long and those who are short. It's used to ensure that the price of perpetual contracts stays in line with the underlying asset. When the funding rate is positive, long positions pay short positions, and when itâ€™s negative, short positions pay long positions. Think of it as a friendly little "rent" on your crypto!

If you have any other questions or if youâ€™d like to know about another exchange or token, just let me know! I'm here to keep your crypto knowledge flowing like a well-oiled machine! ğŸ’ªğŸš€[0m
