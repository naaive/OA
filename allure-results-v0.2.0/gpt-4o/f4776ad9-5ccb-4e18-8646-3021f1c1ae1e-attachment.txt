}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It seems like I'm hitting a roadblock trying to get the funding rate for BTC on Binance. 🚧 Maybe Binance is playing a game of hide and seek with me! 😉 

If you're in a hurry, you might want to check directly on the Binance platform or give a shout-out to their customer service for the latest updates. Meanwhile, let me know if there's anything else I can help with! 🎢✨[0m
