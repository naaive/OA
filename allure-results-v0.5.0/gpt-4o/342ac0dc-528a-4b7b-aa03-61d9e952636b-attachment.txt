}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It looks like I'm hitting a roadblock trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack when the haystack is on vacation! 🌾🏝️

While I can't fetch that information directly from Binance right now, you can check their website or app for the latest updates. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you might try a different exchange to get the funding rate.

If there's anything else you'd like to explore, just let me know! 🚀💡[0m
