responded: Oh no! It seems like I'm having a little trouble connecting to Binance to fetch the funding rate for BTC. 😅 It’s like trying to get a pizza delivered to a restricted area – just not happening!

But don't worry, I can search for the funding rate information elsewhere! Let me look for that juicy data for you. 🍕💰

Give me a moment! 🕵️‍♂️✨
