}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOh no! It seems like Binance is playing hard to get right now, and I can't fetch the funding rate for BTC/USDT. 😅 It’s like trying to catch a slippery fish in a pond full of quicksand!

But don’t worry! You could check directly on the Binance platform or other crypto tracking sites. If you’ve got a fishing rod (or a good VPN), you might just reel in that info! 🎣
