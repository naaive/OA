}[0m[32;1m[1;3mOops! It seems like I've hit a snag trying to fetch the funding rate for BTC on Binance. 🚧 Binance is feeling a bit shy and isn't sharing its info from my current location.

But don't worry, I'm here to help! You can check the funding rate directly on Binance's website or let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore in the crypto world! 🌍✨[0m
