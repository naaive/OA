The funding rate is basically a periodic payment made between long and short positions on perpetual futures contracts. It’s like a little rent you pay to keep your position open! If the rate is positive, long positions pay short positions, and if it's negative, short positions pay long positions. It’s all about keeping things balanced, kind of like a seesaw at the playground! 🎢

If you've got another exchange in mind or any other questions, let me know! I'm here to keep the crypto party going! 🎉[0m
