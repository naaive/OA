But hold onto your hats, because it's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride lately! 🎢 In the last 24 hours, BTC has seen a change of about **-4.19%**. So, if it were a mood, it might be feeling a bit down today. 😢

Market cap? We're talking a whopping **$1.37 trillion**! And trading volume over the last day has been around **$49.93 billion**. That's a lot of dough being tossed around! 🍕💸
