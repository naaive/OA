But don't worry, folks! The market isn't sleeping just because the API is down. I can tell you that the funding rates are updated periodically, so it's possible that the rate has been updated already.

Let me check the latest data from a reliable source... ğŸ¤”

It seems like the funding rate for BTC/USDT might be subject to change frequently, and it's best to check the Binance website or API directly for the most up-to-date information. You can also try checking other cryptocurrency exchanges to see if they have similar funding rates.

Thanks for understanding, and I hope this helps! ğŸ˜Š[0m
